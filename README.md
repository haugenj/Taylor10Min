# tay

A little cmd line program to practice learning the verses of Taylor Swift's "All Too Well" 10 minute version.

The binary was built on an x86 Mac and should run if you have an intel Mac. Otherwise if you have Go installed, you can run `$ make run` to build and run. 

Originally made to delight and impress a girl I liked. We live together now :)
